# Chime! 
### Reimagining What Banking Is 

# Overview and Origin
Financial technology company "that partners with national banks to help provide access to easy-to-use financial products for consumers" 
Chime is reimagining what banking is starting with better banking products. For example, basic banking services are free.
In addition there are no overdraft fees, monthly service fees, or minimum balance requirements.
* What is the name of the company?

Chime 

* When was the company incorporated?

2012 

* Who are the founders of the company?

Co founders are Chris Britt and Ryan King 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The company came about because the co-founders believed that regular banking institutions were not working for everyday people. The other financial institutions were "treating customers as an afterthought instead of the center". The cost of entry to basic banking was high, they have hidden fees and these banks' products and services weren't made for the people living paycheck to paycheck. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Revenue comes from mainly transactions and a small amount from Visa when members use chime card. The company is funded by their partners The Bancorp Bank,N.A. or Stride Bank,N.A.;Members FDIC. 

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Other financial service companies exploit customer by selling expensive financial products and services like high-interest credit cards, payday loans, and overdraft fees.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Everyday Americans, Chime's members often struggle with the high costs and barriers to entry in traditional financial services. People who are paycheck to paycheck or even students.  

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)

Chime built tools and features that weren't available to consumers a few years ago, to help "unlock financial progress". Chime was a pioneer in fee-free overdraft. They launched "SpotMe" which allows members to go into overdraft fee-free up to $200. In addition, Chime offers a newer way to bank to help members in which regular financial institutions do not. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

Chime has implemented many new technologies as well as services to stay competitive. Here are a few:

Blockchain technology: "represents a new approach to recording and verifying transactions across a decentralized and distributed network of computers". Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) which is when each block in a chain contains a number of transaction, every time a new one occurs a record is kept and added to every participant's ledger.

Chime is implementing this it its use "in facilitating peer to peer payments, executing smart contracts that automatically enforce the terms of a contract and enhancing security and efficiency of supply chains".

Financial Technology - Neobanking 

Chime is not a bank they are a financial technology company. "Creates financial products in full partnership with partner banks , which are subject to the same oversight and regulations that traditional banks face".
